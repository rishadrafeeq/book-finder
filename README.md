# ðŸ“š Book Finder

Hey there! This is a simple book search app I built using React. It helps you find books easily - just type what you're looking for and it'll show you results from Open Library.

I made this for my friend Alex who's in college and always needs to find books for assignments. But honestly, anyone who loves reading will find it useful!

## What can you do with it?

- **Search for books** by title, author, or topic
- **Browse featured books** - I added some cool sections like "Recent Books" and "Top 10 Bestsellers"
- **See book details** - covers, authors, when it was published, etc.
- **Works on phone and computer** - responsive design that looks good everywhere
- **Clean, modern look** - dark theme that's easy on the eyes
- **Quick suggestions** - click on popular search terms to get started fast

## How to run it on your computer

First, make sure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or newer). If you don't have it, just download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

Then follow these steps:

1. **Download the code**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishadrafeeq/book-finder.git
cd book-finder
```

2. **Install the required packages**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the app**
```bash
npm start
```

4. **Open your browser** and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! The app should be running on your computer.

## What I used to build this

- **React** - for the user interface
- **Tailwind CSS** - for making it look pretty
- **Open Library API** - to get all the book data
- **Create React App** - to set everything up easily

## How to use the app

It's pretty straightforward:

1. **Type what you're looking for** - could be a book title, author name, or topic
2. **Choose how to search** - by title, author, or subject
3. **Click search** and see the results
4. **Click on any book** to see more details
5. **Use the quick search buttons** if you want some inspiration

The app also has some nice sections on the home page where you can browse popular books without searching.

## Why I made it look this way

I wanted it to be:
- **Easy on the eyes** - dark theme with nice gradients
- **Simple to use** - clean cards and clear buttons
- **Works everywhere** - looks good on phones, tablets, and computers
- **Fun to interact with** - smooth animations when you hover over things
- **Helpful** - clear messages when something goes wrong

## About the data

All the book information comes from Open Library, which is a free database of books. It's pretty comprehensive and has millions of books in it.

## For developers (if you want to understand the code)

The app is organized into different components:
- **Home.js** - the main page with search and featured books
- **BookCard.js** - shows individual book information
- **SearchBar.js** - the search input and buttons
- **Navbar.js** - the navigation at the top
- **About.js, Contact.js** - other pages
- **bookService.js** - handles all the API calls

## Available commands

- `npm start` - runs the app on your computer
- `npm build` - creates a production version
- `npm test` - runs tests (though I haven't written many yet)
